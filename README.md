## KYLER'S SPEED CIRCUIT

Kyler's Speed Circuit is an Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy Analyzer that is tailored to a specific circuit\(Kyler's Circuit\) and fitted with said circuit. Through a customizeable process, whether one wants everything to be automated, or if one wants to look closely at a specific dataset or graph, Kyler' Speed Circuit can cover all essential functionality. It is derived from Kristian Knudsen's PyEIS library, which has a plethora of different circuits, most of which we do not need. 

## Update to come

We are working to secede from the PyEIS Library in order to maintain our own dependencies. We are also working to also adjust functioning in the Libraries to customize our own needs.
