Using PyEIS library, developed custom Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy

-Moving to secede from the PyEIS Library in order to maintain our own dependencies
-Working to also adjust functioning in the Libraries to customize our own needs as the
-functions in the PyEIS library are way more than we need
-Will also be adding documentation to the new edition
