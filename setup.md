# Setup

## Download Repository

In order to download the repository, we can go directly to this following url: [https://github.com/WildcatDiscovery/Kyler\_Speed\_Circuit](https://github.com/WildcatDiscovery/Kyler_Speed_Circuit). This page will take you to a repository of our work, and clicking the green button in the corner which says 'Clone or Download' will let you either download as a zip.

## Anaconda

Anaconda is the leading choice for data scientists all over the world, and it's open source! It comes with pre-installed packages so you don't have to download any of the other modules separately. 

You can go directly to this website [https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and click download to get all the necessary packaging. You don't even need to separately download python. 

Once you downloaded Anaconda, you can run the installer and follow the directions to standard download. 

![Once you finished downloading, you can open Anaconda in the start tab](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2837%29.png)

![Once you click on Anaconda Navigator, you should see an opening screen like this.](.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

Anaconda should come with the Jupyter package, but if it doesn't, you can search for it on the Anaconda navigator and manually download it.Clicking on Jupyter Notebook should take you to a separate screen in your browser which displays the contents of your entire computer

![You can now explore your computer on Anaconda! Now we look for the folder that has our library!](.gitbook/assets/image%20%2829%29.png)

My library is in my Desktop, but if you downloaded the repository as a zip file, you can go into Downloads, and look for the folder in there

Once we find the folder and open it, it should look a little like this

We're going to open one of the files in the python\_notebooks to get started.

Click on the Introduction to highlight it, and press Run above it, or press Shift+Enter. Any cell can be run the same way.

**Anyone of the pages in the gitbook are also available in python notebook form so that users can interact with the functions.**

**ALSO, IF YOU SEE THIS AN SMALL HOURGLASS ICON IN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE, THAT MEANS THE PAGE IS RUNNING A CELL! ONLY ONE CELL CAN RUN AT A TIME, SO IF THAT HOURGLASS IS SPINNING, IT IS TRYING TO EXECUTE A CELL**
